# Photo Renamer Script

This is a simple Python script that renames all the photos in a folder, assigning them sequential numbers (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, etc.), while preserving their original file extension.

## How to Use:

1. Modify the `images/path/folder` variable in the script to match the path to your image folder.
2. Run the script with Python 3.x:
    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```
3. The photos will be renamed in sequential order.
